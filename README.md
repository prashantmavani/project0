# project0
Project 0 for cs50. Completed all the requirements but it's not a sexy website. In the future to make a beautiful site I need to learn 
more about how to work with Bootstrap. Also using scss was nice to make my own stylesheets. I may revisit this at some point to make 
it more appealing but I want to get to the part where I can get my site to actually do something. The design and layout of a site
is equally as, if not more, imporant than the functionality and purpose of a site so I know I can't ignore that aspect.
